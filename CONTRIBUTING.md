## üìú Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Finding Issues to Work On

1. **Good First Issues**: Look for issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/OpenHealthLab/HealthAPI/labels/good%20first%20issue) - these are great for newcomers
2. **Help Wanted**: Check [`help wanted`](https://github.com/OpenHealthLab/HealthAPI/labels/help%20wanted) label for issues that need community support
3. **Bug Reports**: Look for [`bug`](https://github.com/OpenHealthLab/HealthAPI/labels/bug) labeled issues
4. **Feature Requests**: Explore [`enhancement`](https://github.com/OpenHealthLab/HealthAPI/labels/enhancement) labeled issues

### Before You Start

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Comment on the issue** you'd like to work on to claim it
3. **Wait for assignment** before starting major work
4. **Ask questions** if anything is unclear

## üíª Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- pip and virtualenv
- (Optional) Docker for containerized development

### Local Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HealthAPI.git
cd HealthAPI

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenHealthLab/HealthAPI.git
```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash

mkdir -p uploads ml_models
```

6. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**
```bash
pre-commit install
```

7. **Verify Setup**
```bash
# Run tests
pytest

## üìã Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with these tools:

#### Code Formatting
- **Black**: Code formatter (line length: 88)
```bash
black app/ tests/
```

#### Code Quality
- **Flake8**: Linting
```bash
flake8 app/ tests/
```

- **isort**: Import sorting
```bash
isort app/ tests/
```

- **mypy**: Type checking
```bash
mypy app/
```

#### Running All Checks
```bash
# Pre-commit will run these automatically
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Code Style Guidelines

1. **Type Hints**: Always use type hints
```python
def predict_image(image: UploadFile, model: str = "default") -> PredictionResponse:
    pass
```

2. **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
```python
def process_image(image_path: str) -> np.ndarray:
    """Process image for model inference.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to the image file.
        
    Returns:
        Processed image as numpy array.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If image format is not supported.
    """
    pass
```

3. **Function Length**: Keep functions focused and concise (<50 lines)

4. **Variable Names**: Use descriptive names
```python
# Good
prediction_confidence = 0.95
user_uploaded_file = request.file

# Bad
pc = 0.95
f = request.file
```

5. **Error Handling**: Always handle exceptions appropriately
```python
try:
    result = process_image(path)
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Image processing failed: {e}")
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

1. **Test Coverage**: Aim for >80% coverage
2. **Test Structure**: Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
3. **Test Naming**: Use descriptive names

```python
def test_predict_endpoint_returns_valid_response():
    """Test that predict endpoint returns proper response structure."""
    # Arrange
    client = TestClient(app)
    image_file = create_test_image()
    
    # Act
    response = client.post("/api/v1/predict", files={"file": image_file})
    
    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "prediction_class" in response.json()
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_api.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_api.py::test_predict_endpoint_returns_valid_response
```

### Test Organization

- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Mirror the app structure
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Mock external dependencies

## üìñ Documentation

### Documentation Standards

1. **Code Comments**: Explain "why", not "what"
2. **Docstrings**: Document all public functions and classes
3. **README Updates**: Update if adding features
4. **API Documentation**: FastAPI auto-generates, ensure schemas are documented

### Updating Documentation

- Update `README.md` for user-facing changes
- Update `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for development changes
- Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for architectural changes
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### PR Template Checklist

Fill out the PR template completely:
- Clear description of changes

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: CI/CD must pass

git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream main into your branch
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Rebase your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature
git rebase main
```
