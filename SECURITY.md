# Security Policy

## üîí Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Healthcare AI Backend seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Open a Public Issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report Privately

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**[INSERT SECURITY EMAIL HERE]**

Include the following information:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability
- Any potential mitigations you've identified

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity

We will:
1. Confirm receipt of your vulnerability report
2. Investigate and validate the issue
3. Develop and test a fix
4. Release a security patch
5. Publicly disclose the vulnerability (with credit to you, if desired)

## üõ°Ô∏è Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying Healthcare AI Backend:

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   - Update `API_KEY` in `.env` file
   - Use strong, unique API keys

2. **Use HTTPS**
   - Always use TLS/SSL in production
   - Configure proper certificates

3. **Database Security**
   - Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite in production
   - Enable database authentication
   - Use connection pooling with proper limits

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
   - Rotate credentials regularly

5. **File Upload Security**
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Scan uploaded files for malware
   - Store uploads outside web root
   - Use signed URLs for file access

6. **Network Security**
   - Configure CORS properly for your domain
   - Use rate limiting
   - Implement IP whitelisting if needed
   - Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

7. **Monitoring**
   - Enable logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for security events

### For Contributors

When contributing code:

1. **Never Commit Secrets**
   - No API keys, passwords, or tokens
   - Use `.env.example` for templates
   - Review commits before pushing

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before database operations
   - Use Pydantic schemas for validation

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Review security advisories
   - Use `safety check` before committing

4. **Code Review**
   - Security-focused code reviews
   - Check for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
   - Follow OWASP guidelines

5. **Testing**
   - Write security tests
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Test input validation

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

This is a **research and educational project**. It is **NOT** intended for:
- Clinical use
- Medical diagnosis
- Production healthcare environments without proper security hardening

### Areas Requiring Additional Security (Production)

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Current: Simple API key
   - Recommended: JWT tokens, OAuth2, role-based access control

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Current: No PHI/PII protection
   - Recommended: HIPAA compliance, data encryption, audit logging

3. **Model Security**
   - Current: No model versioning or validation
   - Recommended: Model signing, version control, adversarial testing

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Current: Development setup
   - Recommended: Container security, network segmentation, DDoS protection

## üìã Security Checklist for Production

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Change all default credentials
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Configure CORS for specific domains
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Enable database authentication
- [ ] Use secrets management
- [ ] Implement proper logging
- [ ] Set up backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Conduct security audit
- [ ] Implement WAF
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Enable automatic security updates
- [ ] Document security procedures
- [ ] Train team on security practices

## üîç Security Audits

We welcome security audits from the community. If you're conducting a security audit:

1. Please inform us beforehand
2. Respect user privacy and data
3. Do not perform destructive testing
4. Share your findings responsibly
