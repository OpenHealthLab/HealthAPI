# Deprecation Warnings Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the deprecation warnings that were identified and the fixes applied.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Torchvision 'pretrained' Parameter (✅ RESOLVED)

**Warning:**
```
UserWarning: The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future, please use 'weights' instead.
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `app/ml/models/chest_xray_model.py`
- Changed `models.resnet18(pretrained=False)` to `models.resnet18(weights=None)`
- This follows the new torchvision API convention introduced in version 0.13+

**File Modified:**
- `app/ml/models/chest_xray_model.py` (line 8)

## Remaining Warnings (Library-Level Issues)

### 2. Passlib 'crypt' Module Deprecation

**Warning:**
```
DeprecationWarning: 'crypt' is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.13
  from crypt import crypt as _crypt
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Not fixable at application level

**Explanation:**
- This warning originates from passlib library's internal code (`passlib/utils/__init__.py:854`)
- The Python standard library's `crypt` module is deprecated in Python 3.11+ and will be removed in Python 3.13
- Passlib 1.7.4 (latest stable release) still uses this module internally
- This is a known issue in the passlib project awaiting a new release

**Impact:**
- No functional impact on current Python 3.12
- Will need passlib update when migrating to Python 3.13+

### 3. Argon2 Version Access Deprecation

**Warning:**
```
DeprecationWarning: Accessing argon2.__version__ is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use importlib.metadata directly to query for argon2-cffi's packaging metadata.
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Not fixable at application level

**Explanation:**
- This warning comes from passlib's argon2 handler (`passlib/handlers/argon2.py:716`)
- Passlib tries to check argon2-cffi version using the deprecated `__version__` attribute
- The argon2-cffi project deprecated direct version access in favor of `importlib.metadata`
- Passlib 1.7.4 has not been updated to use the new method

**Updates Applied:**
- Updated `requirements.txt` to use argon2-cffi>=23.1.0 (latest version)
- Updated passlib version constraint to <2.0.0 for future compatibility

**Impact:**
- No functional impact
- Warnings are informational only
- Will be resolved when passlib releases an update

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully with only the library-level warnings remaining:

```bash
# Integration test - torchvision warning FIXED ✅
tests/test_integration.py::test_end_to_end_prediction_workflow PASSED

# Auth test - passlib warnings remain (library issue)
tests/test_v2_auth.py::test_user_registration PASSED
```

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action:** None required. All application code has been updated.

2. **Future Monitoring:**
   - Watch for passlib releases that address Python 3.13 compatibility
   - Consider alternative password hashing libraries if passlib is not updated before Python 3.13 migration
   - Monitor passlib GitHub repository: https://github.com/glic3rinu/passlib

3. **Python 3.13 Migration:**
   - Before upgrading to Python 3.13, ensure passlib has released a compatible version
   - Alternative: Consider switching to `bcrypt` or `argon2-cffi` directly with custom implementation

## Files Modified

1. `app/ml/models/chest_xray_model.py` - Fixed torchvision deprecation
2. `requirements.txt` - Updated argon2-cffi and passlib version constraints

## Conclusion

The application code has been fully updated to address deprecation warnings. The remaining warnings are library-level issues that will be resolved when passlib releases an update. These warnings do not affect functionality and are safe to ignore for now.
